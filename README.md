# Real Estate Admin Dashboard API

This README provides detailed information about 
the backend implementation of the Admin Dashboard for a real estate website.
The backend is built using **Node.js** and **Express** and handles core
functionality for user management, analytics, and activity tracking.

## **Features**

### **1. User Management**
- Approve or ban users:
  - Approve new users pending registration.
  - Ban or deactivate existing users.
- Endpoints for managing user status.

### **2. Website Analytics**
- Retrieve key metrics such as:
  - Daily and weekly active users.
  - Page views.
- (Optional) Integration with Google Analytics or other services for advanced metrics.

### **3. User Activity Tracking**
- Log user actions such as:
  - Login, logout.
  - Downloads.
  - Page views.
- Provide endpoints for fetching and filtering activity logs by date, user, or action type.

### **4. Security & Access Control**
- Implement role-based authentication:
  - Only admin users can access the dashboard.
- Middleware for securing routes.


## **Tech Stack**

### **Backend**
- Node.js
- Express.js
- TypeScript (for type safety)

### **Database**
